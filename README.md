## Features:
- SuperCopy (Copy X rows in 1 column and add ; in between)
- S
- Update detection (Detect when a newer version of the add-in is available)

## Installation:
Just run the .msi, it will install the required files and register the add-in in Excel. It doesn't require admin rights since the installation is only for the current user.
