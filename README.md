## Features:
- Super Copy (Copies a row or a column and add a delimiter in between values)
- Settings configurable in a Custom Task Pane
- Update detection (Detect when a newer version of the add-in is available)

## Installation:
Just run the .msi, it will install the required files and register the add-in in Excel. It doesn't require admin rights since the installation is only for the current user.
